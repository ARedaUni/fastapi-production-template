This entire template has one goal, to create a very lightweight fastapi production template that is extensible and can be used anywhere. Most applications use postgres, i want to remove all the hassle from setting up a new fastapi project and getting it to a point where it can be deployed to production.

existing solutions are either old or very lackluster, or very very complex(the offical template which also locks you in to many technologies and even has a frontend smh smh)

I want something anyone can use off the bat that is reliable which requires minimal configuration. 


some more changes that i need:
Scope Support:
Simple implementation for permission control
Crucial for API security even in lightweight apps
app/schemas
class TokenData(BaseModel):
    """Token payload data."""
    username: str | None = None
    scopes: list[str] = []
Rate Limiting:
Basic protection against abuse
Can be implemented with simple middleware
CORS Configuration:
Missing in your FastAPI setup
Essential for browser clients
app
Health Check Endpoint:
Missing but needed for deployment monitoring
Structured Logging:
No logging configuration visible
Critical for production troubleshooting
Environment Variable Validation:
Your settings use hardcoded defaults
Should validate required env vars on startup
Database Migrations:
No migration system visible
Essential for production database changes
